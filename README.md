Project Summary: Textual Data Analysis

This project focuses on extracting text data from provided URLs, performing text analysis, and computing specific variables. Below is a concise summary of the project:

Objective:
The primary objective is to extract textual data from articles listed in the "input.xlsx" file, analyze the text, and compute various variables as defined in "Text Analysis.docx." The computed variables are then saved following the format in "Output Data Structure.xlsx."

Project Components:

Data Extraction:

Input: URLs and article information in "input.xlsx."
Extraction: Python programming and web scraping libraries are used to extract article text while excluding headers, footers, and other content.
Saving: Extracted articles are saved as text files with filenames as URL_IDs.
Data Analysis:

Input: Extracted article text from text files.
Analysis: Python is used to perform textual analysis, compute variables, and match their definitions in "Text Analysis.docx."
Output: Computed variables are saved in the same order as specified in "Output Data Structure.xlsx."
Variables to Compute:
Several variables are computed during textual analysis, including positive and negative scores, polarity score, subjectivity score, sentence length, percentage of complex words, and more.

Project Execution:
Follow these steps for project execution:

Extract data from URLs, ensuring that only article text is captured.
Perform textual analysis on the extracted text, adhering to variable definitions.
Save the computed variables in an output file matching the format in "Output Data Structure.xlsx."
